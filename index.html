                    Hi, My name is Jonathan Park, and my ethnicity is Korean and I'm a Undergraduate Student at Queens College. I am majoring in Computer Science. I went to Queensborough Community College then transfered to Queens College since its the closest to my house out of all the CUNY's and also was a way to be with my mother and take care of her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The picture above is a picture that I took during my trip to South Korea with my mother and I was in middle school but this picture is important as this is the last picture I took during South Korea which is a place my mother was born and loved. It's very important as she recently passed away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dream was to have a stable job and help out my parents and send my mother to South Korea as a trip since she misses her family there and the last time we visited, she had a very fun time there but since my mother passed, I'm currently trying to find a purpose and I haven't figured it out yet. It seems like it would take a while for me to figure things out.
                </p>
