I created the Quiz App and added a start quiz using the questions that we were given from the json file. I added a feature where you can pick the number of questions you want to do and also a timer and you get the option of picking on how many seconds you want to take for each question when taking the quiz. Once you start, the timer starts and you have the pick an answer within that time period and if not it would tell you what the correct answer is but wouldn't give you the point. If you got the question incorrect, then you also don't get a point and also shows you the answer to the question. Once you finish the quiz, you get to see the score you got. If you want, you can restart and do the quiz again and you can even change it up a bit by changing the amount of questions you want and change the timer for each question.
